# BrainHack 2025 Project - Investigating the Usage of Brain Blood Oxygen Levels as a Proxy for Neural Synchrony and Task Connectedness.

Nerual Synchrony refers to the phenomena in which the neural activity between two or more people become correlated in a certain environment. Research utilizing nerual synchrony approaches have provided important insight into social neuralcognitive activty, conducive in elucidating the critial social mechanisms such as communication, language processing, and cooperation. However, investigation of neural synchrony is currently restricted to the analysis of brain wave activity data, collected using EEG monitors, which are quite expensive and limits its implementation in future studies within this field of neuroscience.

In this project, we propose that the use of brain-localized blood oxygen levels can be used as a proxy of synchrony, collected through HEG monitors. If these monitors record high levels of correlation, this would make HEG a promising and cheaper alternative for neural research. 

## Dataset 
For this project we measured the blood oxygen levels between two individual performing the same task collaboratively. To do this, individuals were made to avoid any interactions for 10 seconds as baseline, then for 50 seconds worked together to perform a moderately complex task.

Blood oxygen measurements were made using the Delobotomizer devices (Version 1 and Version 2) over a 60 second timeframe simultaneously. The details regarding these devices can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/joshbrew/HEG_ESP32_Delobotomizer/tree/main).

This dataset includes readings extracted from two individuals performing the following tasks:
- Solving a Jigsaw puzzle
- Iteratively creating a story in turn
- Watching media
- Meditating
